# OpenTPU
Open source Timer processor built on top on a standard MCU.
  
**Goals**  
* Direct interfacing of up to 3 VR or hall sensors, onboard signal conditioning.
* All outputs controlled by hardware timers - no SW latency
* 8 injector outputs - Saturated or peak and hold
* 4 coil outputs
* Controlled via SPI or UART
* Watchdog mechanism
* Interrupt/integration outputs (TDC, Knock/map sensor windows)
